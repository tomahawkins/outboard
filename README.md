# Overview

Outboard motors are amazingly well engineered machines.
In a relatively small, light weight package, a tiller outboard motor makes up nearly 
an entire vehicle system including fuel delivery, carburetion, powerhead,
exhaust, cooling, drive, transmission, traction, and steering.
All that's remaining for a complete boat is a hull and a fuel tank.

In this course we'll be wrenching on the OMC Johnson/Evinrude
9.9 and 15 HP motors manufactured from 1974 to 1992.
This motor is reliable and easy to work on, with parts still readily available.
It is light enough that two kids can lift it on to a motor stand or boat transom
and yet has the power to pull an adult wakeboarder (with driver and spotter in boat).
Mounted on a lightweight hull, the 15 HP will achieve 22 knots, putting Lummi Island
within 15 minutes and Orcas Island in under an hour.
