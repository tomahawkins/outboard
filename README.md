# Overview

Why outboards?  Because they're cool, practical, and amazingly well engineered machines.
In a relatively small package, an outboard motor makes up nearly 
an entire vehicle system: fuel delivery, carburation, power head,
exhaust, cooling, drive, transmission, traction, and steering.
Just add a hull and gas tank and
you can boat from point A to point B at high velocity.

In this course we will be wrenching on the OMC Evinrude/Johnson
9.9 and 15 HP motors manufactured from 1974 to 1992.
This great little motor is reliable, easy to work on, and easy to get parts for.
It is light enough that two kids can lift it on to a motor stand or transom
and yet has the power to pull an adult wakeboarder with a spotter in the boat.
Mounted on a lightweight hull, the 15 HP will achieve 22 knots, putting Lummi Island
within 15 minutes and Orcas Island in under an hour.
