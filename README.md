# Overview

Outboard motors are amazingly well engineered machines.
In a relatively small, light weight package, a tiller outboard motor makes up nearly 
an entire vehicle system including fuel delivery, carburetion, powerhead,
exhaust, cooling, drive, transmission, traction, and steering.
All that's remaining for a complete boat is a hull and a fuel tank.

In this course we'll be wrenching on the OMC Johnson/Evinrude
9.9 and 15 HP motors manufactured from 1974 to 1992.
This motor is reliable and easy to work on, with parts still readily available.
It is light enough that two kids can lift it on to a motor stand or boat transom
and yet has the power to pull an adult wakeboarder (with driver and spotter in boat).
Mounted on a lightweight hull, the 15 HP will achieve 22 knots, putting Lummi Island
within 15 minutes and Orcas Island in under an hour.


# Safety

- Wear mask and eye protection at all times.
- Wear ear protection when operating or near to loud machinery.
- Wear leather gloves when there is risk of hand injury.
- Wear nitrile gloves or wash hands frequently.
- Fire extinguisher, first aid kit, eye flush kit is on hand in garage.
- Hose and soap available outside garage.


# Class Routine

We will start each class by reviewing the challenge problems from the previous lesson.
These will be mathematical and engineering in nature, related to the current material we
are exploring in the course.

We will then have a brief lecture, covering the work planned for the day
and delving into various engineering topics.
The lecture will conclude with a new challenge problem for
the week that students are expected to attempt before the next class.

The rest class is dedicated to working on our motors,
performing the planned tasks.

We conclude each class with clean up consisting of:

1. Reassembling our motors to the best extent.
2. Organizing loose parts in bags with labels, placing all parts in the part box.
3. Cleaning the workstation and floor ensuring it is free of dirt, grease, and oil.
4. Moving the motors, motor stands, workbenches, and parts boxes out of the way so Aruna can park her car.

find a reasonably priced copy.  Search for "OMC Service Manual, 9.9 Thru 30 Models".
